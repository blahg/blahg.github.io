What do I think about soulmates?
Regarding "Soulmates", I generally percieve it to be somthing related to romantic aspects of life. Maybe it's the movies, songs, and the societal narrative of the word that has led me to perciece it in this way. But I do connect with some peoples even when I'm not romantically attracted to them, and I think our souls help us to do that. 
<br/>
We all know that `The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another`.  And  if our souls exist, it has to be in the form of an energy. Our mythology also says that our souls leave the body, so the same energy or our soul gets transmitted from one body to another. However, the human population is constantly increasing,and energy can not be created, so, it would be easier to think that our souls are splitting and the energy from every person is being transferred to many persons instead going to just one person.
<br/>
If you are still reading, get ready for some conspiracy theories. If our souls are splitting, as per the theory presented above, there must be some consequences to it.
<br/>
- Would it be easier to connect with others easily? Because the idea of soulmates revolves around some beliefs that says that two souls that are destined to be together, stays connected forever. But as our souls are splitting, would not it be correct to say that two persons that are soulmates might split into four persons with the same two souls? It might sound confusing but I hope you are following what I'm trying to say.
Let's say ***A*** and ***B*** were soulmates born in the 1940s. Both of them died and their Souls got divided into halves. So, four persons ***A1***, ***A2***,***B1***, and ***B2*** born in 2010s (say), would have the 2 souls, each having the halves of ***A***, and ****B***.

    A --- |Soulmates|B(B)
    A-->|Split|A1;
    A-->|Split|A2;
    B-->|Split|B1;
    B-->|Split|B2;
    A1--B1;
    A1--B2;
    A2--B1;
    A2--B2;
</div>
<br/>So, two pairs might be formed. Again, A1 or A2 can connect with both B1, and B2, as souolmates and vice-versa.
<br/>

But, it should also be considered that a soul might not divide at all. Or, it might divide into more than two pieces. It gets messy if we think further about it. I won't write about that, you can think about it.
<br/>
To conclude, I don't know what to write. I do believe in soulmates. But I also ignored the idea of conversion of energy from one form to another, that might lead to other thoeries as well. 
<br/>We all might just be vibrating strings of energy levels, so at our core we all might just some souls that are copy of a copy of a copy.
